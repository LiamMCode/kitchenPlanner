# 2D Canvas Planner Task

This is a starter application for building your very own Kitchen planner in TypeScript and Canvas 2D!

To get started just clone down the repo and run `npm install` in the directory. To start the app and run a watcher with webpack just run the comand `npm run start`, this will start a server on http://localhost:1234 and automatically rebuild the bundle whenever you edit a file.
